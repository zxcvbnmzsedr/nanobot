# Install and Quick Start

This page gets one local nanobot reply working. After that, you can add the WebUI, chat apps, local models, web search, MCP, deployment, or custom plugins.

If you have never used a terminal or edited a config file before, use [`start-without-technical-background.md`](./start-without-technical-background.md) first. This page assumes you are comfortable pasting commands and editing JSON snippets.

## Before You Start

You need:

- Python 3.11 or newer.
- One LLM provider, company endpoint, subscription endpoint, or local model server you can call. The examples below use a generic OpenAI-compatible `custom` provider so the compact path does not recommend one hosted service; any supported provider works when the key, provider name, and model ID match.
- Git only if you install from source.
- Node.js or Bun only if you are developing the WebUI itself.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Repository docs may describe features that are available first in source. Install from PyPI or `uv` for the stable day-to-day release; install from source when you want the newest repository behavior or plan to contribute.

## 1. Install

Pick one install method.

**One-command setup:**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HKUDS/nanobot/main/scripts/install.sh | sh
```

On Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HKUDS/nanobot/main/scripts/install.ps1 | iex
```

The default command installs or upgrades `nanobot-ai` from PyPI, then starts `nanobot onboard --wizard`. It avoids system-wide pip installs by using an active virtual environment, `uv`, `pipx`, or a managed venv under `~/.nanobot/venv`. If Quick Start finishes, go straight to [Open the WebUI](#5-open-the-webui).

To preview the plan without changing your environment, pass `--dry-run`; combine it with `--dev` when you want to preview the main-branch install.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HKUDS/nanobot/main/scripts/install.sh | sh -s -- --dry-run
```

```powershell
& ([scriptblock]::Create((irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HKUDS/nanobot/main/scripts/install.ps1))) --dry-run
```

To install the current `main` branch instead, pass `--dev`:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HKUDS/nanobot/main/scripts/install.sh | sh -s -- --dev
```

```powershell
& ([scriptblock]::Create((irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HKUDS/nanobot/main/scripts/install.ps1))) --dev
```

If `curl` or `irm` is unavailable, or GitHub raw downloads are blocked on your network, use one of the manual install methods below.

If you prefer to inspect the script first, open [`../scripts/install.sh`](../scripts/install.sh) or [`../scripts/install.ps1`](../scripts/install.ps1).

**Stable release with `uv`:**

```bash
uv tool install nanobot-ai
nanobot --version
```

**Stable release with pip:**

```bash
python -m pip install nanobot-ai
nanobot --version
```

Use pip only inside an environment you control. If pip reports `externally-managed-environment` on macOS or Linux, use the one-command installer, `uv tool install nanobot-ai`, `pipx install nanobot-ai`, or create a virtual environment first.

**Latest source checkout:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HKUDS/nanobot.git
cd nanobot
python -m pip install -e .
nanobot --version
```

If your shell cannot find `nanobot` after a pip install, run the module form:

```bash
python -m nanobot --version
python -m nanobot onboard
```

On Windows, `~` in the docs means your user profile directory, for example `C:\Users\you`.

The docs use `python` in commands. If your system exposes Python 3.11+ as `python3` or `py`, use that command in the same place, for example `python3 -m pip install nanobot-ai` or `py -m nanobot --version`.

## 2. Initialize

Skip this section if the one-command setup already started the wizard and Quick Start finished there.

```bash
nanobot onboard
```

Use the wizard if you prefer prompts instead of editing JSON by hand:

```bash
nanobot onboard --wizard
```

Initialization creates:

| Path | What it is |
|------|------------|
| `~/.nanobot/config.json` | Main settings file for providers, models, channels, tools, gateway, and API |
| `~/.nanobot/workspace/` | Agent workspace for memory, sessions, heartbeat tasks, skills, and artifacts |

If you already have a config, `nanobot onboard` can refresh missing default fields without overwriting your existing values. Use `nanobot onboard --refresh` to do the same refresh without an interactive prompt.

## 3. Configure a Provider

Skip this section if you already configured provider and model settings in the wizard.

Open `~/.nanobot/config.json`. Add or merge these blocks into the file created by `nanobot onboard`; do not replace the whole file unless you want to reset the config.

**API key:**

```json
{
  "providers": {
    "custom": {
      "apiKey": "your-api-key",
      "apiBase": "https://api.example.com/v1"
    }
  }
}
```

**Model preset:**

```json
{
  "modelPresets": {
    "primary": {
      "label": "Primary",
      "provider": "custom",
      "model": "model-id-from-your-provider",
      "maxTokens": 8192,
      "contextWindowTokens": 65536,
      "temperature": 0.1
    }
  },
  "agents": {
    "defaults": {
      "modelPreset": "primary"
    }
  }
}
```

The provider and model inside a preset must match. The snippet above is only an example. For another provider, replace these values together:

| Replace | Where |
|---|---|
| Provider config key, such as `custom` | `providers.<provider>` |
| API key or environment variable | `providers.<provider>.apiKey` |
| Preset provider name | `modelPresets.primary.provider` |
| Model ID | `modelPresets.primary.model` |
| Endpoint URL, only when needed | `providers.<provider>.apiBase` |

Direct `agents.defaults.provider` and `agents.defaults.model` still work for existing configs, but named presets are the recommended path because they also power `/model` switching and fallback chains. For provider-specific examples across direct, gateway, OAuth, cloud, and local setups, see [`providers.md`](./providers.md).

**What about `apiBase` / base URL?**

`apiBase` is the HTTP base URL of the provider endpoint, not the model name. Most hosted providers in nanobot already know their default endpoint, so you usually only set `apiKey` and a model preset. Set `apiBase` when you are using:

- `custom` for a third-party or self-hosted OpenAI-compatible API;
- a local OpenAI-compatible server such as Ollama, vLLM, or LM Studio;
- a provider-specific alternate endpoint, regional endpoint, proxy, or subscription endpoint.

Examples:

```json
{
  "providers": {
    "custom": {
      "apiKey": "${CUSTOM_API_KEY}",
      "apiBase": "https://api.example.com/v1"
    }
  }
}
```

```json
{
  "providers": {
    "ollama": {
      "apiBase": "http://localhost:11434/v1"
    }
  }
}
```

If the provider's docs say the endpoint is `/v1`, include `/v1` in `apiBase`. The model ID still belongs in the active `modelPresets` entry.

If you prefer not to store secrets in `config.json`, reference an environment variable and set it before starting nanobot:

```json
{
  "providers": {
    "custom": {
      "apiKey": "${PROVIDER_API_KEY}",
      "apiBase": "https://api.example.com/v1"
    }
  }
}
```

## 4. Check the Setup

```bash
nanobot status
```

This should show the config path, workspace path, active model or preset, and provider summary. It does not send a message to the model, so use it as a quick config check before the first real request.

Read it like this:

| Status line | What you want |
|---|---|
| `Config` | A check mark. |
| `Workspace` | A check mark. |
| `Model` | The model or preset you expect. |
| Provider list | Most providers can say `not set`; the provider used by the active preset should show a check mark, OAuth status, or local URL. |

## 5. Open the WebUI

Start the browser workbench:

```bash
nanobot webui
```

`nanobot webui` prepares the local WebSocket channel, starts the gateway, and opens `http://127.0.0.1:8765`. It does not create a gateway password. First-run WebUI setup binds to `127.0.0.1` by default, so it is not exposed to your LAN; remote access uses Kangaroo account authentication. Use `nanobot webui --background` when you want the gateway to keep running without an open terminal.

## 6. Test One CLI Message

Use this path if you skipped Quick Start, declined the WebSocket channel, or want a terminal-only check.

Run a one-shot CLI message:

```bash
nanobot agent -m "Hello!"
```

A successful first run proves that:

- the `nanobot` command is installed;
- `~/.nanobot/config.json` can be loaded;
- the selected provider and model can answer;
- the default workspace can be created and used.

The reply text itself will vary. Any normal assistant answer means the install, config, provider, model, and workspace path are all usable.

If that works, start an interactive CLI chat:

```bash
nanobot agent
```

After the interactive session can answer normally, nanobot can help with its own next setup step. Ask it to read the relevant docs, inspect your current `~/.nanobot/config.json`, and make one concrete change such as enabling WebUI, adding a provider preset, or configuring one chat channel. When nanobot says the config is updated, run `/restart` in the chat or restart the nanobot process manually so long-running processes reload `config.json`.

Example prompt:

```text
Read docs/quick-start.md, docs/providers.md, and docs/configuration.md in this checkout.
Then update ~/.nanobot/config.json to add a model preset named "primary" for my provider.
Tell me exactly what changed and whether I need to run /restart.
```

In interactive mode, `Enter` sends the current message. Press `Alt+Enter` to add a newline before sending.

Exit interactive mode with `exit`, `quit`, `/exit`, `/quit`, `:q`, or `Ctrl+D`.

## Updating

**pip:**

```bash
python -m pip install -U nanobot-ai
nanobot --version
```

If pip reports `externally-managed-environment`, upgrade with the same isolated method you used to install nanobot, such as `uv tool upgrade nanobot-ai`, `pipx upgrade nanobot-ai`, or the managed venv created by the one-command installer.

**uv:**

```bash
uv tool upgrade nanobot-ai
nanobot --version
```

**pipx:**

```bash
pipx upgrade nanobot-ai
nanobot --version
```

**Source checkout:**

```bash
git pull
python -m pip install -e .
nanobot --version
```

If you use WhatsApp from a source checkout, keep the optional dependencies installed:

```bash
nanobot plugins enable whatsapp
```

## First-Run Troubleshooting

| Symptom | What to check |
|---------|---------------|
| `nanobot: command not found` | Use `python -m nanobot ...`, or add your Python scripts directory to `PATH`. |
| `ModuleNotFoundError: nanobot` | Confirm you installed into the same Python environment that is running the command. |
| JSON parse errors | Check commas and braces in `~/.nanobot/config.json`; examples above are partial snippets to merge. |
| Authentication or 401 errors | Check that the API key is valid, copied without spaces, and placed under the provider you selected. |
| Provider/model errors | Make sure the active preset uses the provider that owns your API key and that the model exists there. |
| The CLI works but a chat app does not reply | First keep `nanobot gateway` running, then follow [`chat-apps.md`](./chat-apps.md). |
| WebUI does not open | Run `nanobot webui`; the browser UI uses port `8765`, not the gateway health port `18790`. |
